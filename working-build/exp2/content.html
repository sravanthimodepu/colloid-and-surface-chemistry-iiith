We are familiar with jams, jellies, cheese, curd, boiled egg-white, tofu, bath gels, hair styling gels, soft contact lenses, and many such substances. These substances appear like solids, but they are softer and sometimes spongy. This kind of substances scientifically belongs to the class ‘gels’ (from the latin <i>gelu</i> – freezing, cold, ice or <i>gelatus</i> – frozen, immobile). A ‘gel’ is a colloidal system in which a liquid is dispersed within a solid where the solid is the continuous phase and the liquid is the discontinuous phase. Despite this, gels are typically 90 – 99.5% liquid in volume. In fact, gels consist of a porous, continuous network structure formed from the colloidal particles in the entire volume of the liquid medium and the liquid filling the pores.  Gels are used as stabilizers and thickeners in many food products like in sorbets, pies, ice creams, curds, cream cheese, fruit confectioneries, etc. In food products, gels are used to provide structure, stability, and spaces for holding flavours, sugar, oil, etc. Gel is used as bacterial growth medium in microbiology laboratories. Gels can be made from polysaccharides (e.g., starch, agar, pectin, carrageenans, and alginate), proteins (e.g. gelatine, keratin, casein, and ovalbumin), etc. Here, we shall prepare gel by using polysaccharide agar-agar. Use of agar-agar in several East Asian culinary traditions has been known for over three hundred years. The word ‘agar-agar’ means ‘jelly’ in Malay-Indonesian language.

	<p><h><em> Preparation of a Gel as a Colloid: </em></h></p>
<p>
Agar-agar is extracted from marine agarophytes algae. Agar is the dried hydrophilic, colloidal substance. Chemically it is a complex mixture of polysaccharides composed of two major fractions – agarose and agaropectin units. An agarose chain is a neutral alternating copolymer of &beta;1,3-linked D-galactose and &alpha;-1,4-linked 3,6-anhydro-L-galactose (Figure 1). Normally agarose represents about two-thirds of the natural agar-agar. Agarose is the gelling fraction. Agaropectin is composed of agarose substituted at irregular intervals with sulphate esters, methyl esters, and/or pyruvate residues. It probably exists in the form of calcium salt or a mixture of calcium and magnesium salts. </p>

  <figcaption>Fig1. Structure of an agarose polymer.</figcaption>
</figure>
</center>
</p>

<p>The solubility as well as gel-forming ability of agar polysaccharides depends on the relative hydrophobicity of the basic repeating unit, the alternating 1,3-linked &beta;-&beta;-galactopyranose and 1,4-linked 3,6-anhydro-α-L-galactopyranose  and its substitution by hydrophobic (methoxyl) and polar (sulphate, pyruvate) groups. Although agar-agar is insoluble in cold water but it can absorb about 20 times its own weight of water and swells considerably. It dissolves readily in boiling water. Gelling occurs on cooling the hot solution of agar-agar. Gel formation takes place for even only 0.50% agar-agar solutions at temperatures between ~30°C and 45°C depending on the species of algae used for its extraction. The agar gel is called ‘physical gel’ due to its thermo-reversible nature. Agar gels can be melted by heating and set to gels again on cooling. The gel is melted by heating to 85 – 95°C. This wide gap between the gelling and gel melting temperatures or very high gelling hysteresis of agar-agar, makes it suitable for many food applications.</p>

<p>The agarose chain forms anti-symmetric double helices on cooling that form clumps of helices due to hydrogen bonding. The double helical form of agarose has been proposed to be an intermediate in gelation. Three equatorial hydrogen atoms on the 3,6-anhydro-L-galactose residues, which constrain the molecule to form a helix, give rise to the gelling property of agar-agar. The interaction of the helices causes the formation of the gel. Exterior hydroxyl groups causes aggregation of up to 10,000 of these helices forming suprafibers. The fibre bundles and microgel domains are held together by hydrogen-bonds. These helices interact and grow into still larger structural units eventually forming a three-dimensional continuous network spanning the entire volume of the liquid.  The network structure results in the interstitial pockets of 50 – 200 nm diameters. The liquid is entrapped in the interstitial pockets of the network. Though gels are mostly liquid both by volume and weight, yet they do not flow when in the steady-state and exhibit solid-like behaviour due to the three-dimensional cross-linked network within the liquid. Thermodynamically, the process involves a balance between particle-particle interactions and the particle-solvent interactions in solution. The loss of conformational freedom and hydration energy on gelation is compensated by energetically favourable chain-chain interactions. Agar gel and some other gels melt to liquid states if they are reheated. Because the forces (like configurational entropy) favouring the amorphous state outweigh those (like hydrogen bonds) favouring the aggregated state. </p>

</p>

<p>Degree of hydration plays an important role in the stability of agar-agar gel. In solution, agar-agar is negatively charged. This charge also plays an equally important role in its stability. In addition to the concentration, the strength of the agar-agar gel depends on the pH, sugar content, rate of gelation, etc. Lower agar-agar concentration produces more supple and fragile gel whereas more firm and brittle gel forms at higher concentrations. Increasing quantity of sugar gives harder gels with less cohesive texture. Gel strength decreases with the decrease in the pH of the solution. One should avoid exposing agar-agar solutions to high temperatures or to pHs lower than 6.0 for longer periods of time. Both the factors can degrade solutions of agar-agar which may result in lower gel strength after the gel formation. Atomic force microscope (AFM) images of “unperturbed” gel showed strong dependence of interstitial pore size and its distribution on the ionic strength of the solution, e.g., the concentration of Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer. For a given ionic strength, the pore size decreases and the pore size distribution narrows with the increase in agarose concentration.</p>

<p>Agar gel is used in Cell Structure and Microbiology, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry for electrophoresis, culture media, immunodiffusion, gel chromatography, supports for biocatalysis, growth of protein crystals, etc. Agar-agar, being of vegetable origin, is an ideal substitute for gelatin, an animal product, especially for their use in food products.

<strong>To start the experiment do the following: </strong>
<ol>
<li>
Take a beaker [by clicking on the beaker] of size 2 to 3 times more than the volume of the solution to be prepared.
</li>

<li>
Add required quantity of agar-agar powder to the beaker for the preparation of a 1.0% agar-agar aqueous solution. [Click on the agar container’s spoon to transfer]
</li>

<li>
Add required volume of (1x TBE (Tris-Borate-EDTA), pH 8.6) buffer solution [by clicking on the buffer container]. To facilitate dissolution and avoid clumping of agar, add agar powder slowly to cool buffer solution. Allow agar powder to hydrate in the solution for a few minutes before heating for melting and dissolution. These steps allow a quicker and easier dissolution and reduce foaming.
</li>

<li>
Cover the top of the beaker with a wrap loosely to prevent the solution from boiling over. 
</li>

<li>
Place the beaker in the microwave oven [by clicking on the beaker]. In real operation, one should adjust time and power settings according to the oven output strength. Alternatively, the solution can be heated on a hot plate or over a Bunsen burner.
</li>

<li>
Dissolve agar by heating the solution to the boiling temperature of water in the microwave oven. The solution is boiled only to the extent that ensures total dissolution of agar. Over boiling results in agarose hydrolysis and lower gel strength. In order to prevent overheating, one should put on hot gloves, remove the beaker at regular intervals from the microwave oven, swirl it gently, and place it back in the oven for heating again until the agar melts completely.
</li>

<li>
Remove the wrap. Pour about half of the hot solution in the mould [by clicking on the beaker]. In order to avoid bubble formation and warping of casting tray, one should cool the solution to ~60°C (until the beaker is just comfortable to touch) and pour it carefully into the gel mould.
</li>

<li>
  Allow the solution to cool slowly in the mould because rapid cooling causes irregular gel matrix.
</li>
<li>
  Place an appropriate thermometer in the in the beaker containing half of the hot solution. Allow the solution to cool slowly and observe the temperature fall in the thermometer. In order to note down the gelling temperature, tumble the beaker at regular intervals. The gelation point (temperature) is marked down as the midpoint between the last time (temperature) when there was flow and first time when there is no flow of the agar sample on tumbling the beaker. If one observes the sample carefully, one may recognise the point of gelation visually too. The clear hot solution turns slightly opaque on solidifying.
</li>
<li>
  Place the beaker containing gel in a water bath at 70°C for 1 h. Observe whether the gel melts or not. Increase the temperature of the water bath to 90°C, and observe the gel melting temperature when the gel in the beaker is liquefied forming a clear solution. The melting temperature is marked down as the midpoint between the last time (temperature) when there was no flow and first time when there is flow of the agar sample on tumbling the beaker. If one observes the sample carefully, one may recognise the gel melting temperature visually too.
</li>
<li>
Determine the gelling hysteresis for the agar-agar sample. Compare the gelling hysteresis of agarose gel with that of gelatin gel.
