Most of the products that we use today have involved catalysts at some stages of their production. Metals and metal oxides are highly desirable as catalysts in the chemical industry, fuel cells, waste reduction, bioprocessing, and so on. Finely divided particles have been used as catalysts for years due to their large surface areas. We are familiar with the catalytic properties of finely divided particles of transition metals like platinum, palladium, etc. Though colloidal gold particles have been used for centuries in medicines, colouring ceramics and glasses, etc., gold was not used as catalyst till recently due to its inert nature. In the following we study the use of different sized gold particles as catalysts for the reduction of an organic dye, eosin. The progress of the reaction can be followed spectrophotometrically.

	 <!--<p><em> Kinetics of Gold Particle Formation: </em></p>-->
<p>
Small particles show many interesting physical and chemical properties, which are often drastically different from their bulk counterparts. Many of the properties such as solubility, chemical reactivity, etc. are affected by their small sizes and high surface to volume ratio. The large surface of the particle may be structurally and compositionally different from the bulk due to surface relaxation and reconstruction, the presence of adsorbed layers of reaction by-products and stabilizing molecules, etc. Due to large surface area of contact and also microscopic roughness of the surface, colloidal particles are more reactive than their bulk counterparts since adsorption and reactivity are highly structure-sensitive properties. We have earlier demonstrated the surface area effects on the chemical properties of colloidal Ag particles.  </p>
<p>
Due to the finely divided states of colloidal particles, one can obtain huge surface areas for a given quantity of materials. Therefore by making very small catalyst particles, large surface areas are achieved with a small volume of material. Further such small particles have ample corners, vertices, defects, kinks, and steps. In addition to huge surface areas, different crystallographic facets and increased number of edges, corners, defects, etc. are of critical importance in controlling the catalytic activity and selectivity. Therefore, particles of various different sizes and shapes are highly desirable as catalysts in fuel cells, waste reduction, bioprocessing, and the chemical industry. Though bulk gold is known for its inertness, small particles of gold have been observed to be catalytically active.</p>

<p><em> Kinetics of Gold Particle Catalyzed Reduction of Eosin by Sodium Borohydride: </em></p>-->
<p>
Eosin is an organic water soluble bright red dye used in many applications in biological science, medical science, textile dying, ink manufacturing, etc. Its reduced form is colourless and hence its reduction can be monitored by following the decrease in its absorption peak intensity. Eosin absorbs green light and therefore decrease in eosin absorbance was followed at 535 nm wavelength near its absorption maximum. In the absence of catalysts, one does not observe, in the experimental time scale, the reduction of eosin in aqueous solution by sodium borohydride. However, the rate of reduction reaction becomes appreciably faster in the presence of gold particles. Gold particles here act as catalysts. Depending on the catalysing particle size and concentration (Table 1), the rate of reduction reaction varies though all the sets of particles prepared here have the same quantity of total gold (1×10<sup>-4</sup> M).</p>
<p>
A pseudo-first order kinetics with respect to eosin, i.e., log (A<sub>t</sub> - A<sub>Au</sub>) vs. time could be used in this case, where A<sub>t</sub> stands for absorbance at any time t and A<sub>Au</sub> stands for absorbance of aqueous gold particle system before the addition of dye. Thus one can determine the values of pseudo-first-order rate constants (k) and corresponding correlation coefficients from these plots.

<li><p>Prepare gold seed particles and larger gold particles of three different sizes from these seed particles by using a two-step seed mediated (non-iterative) growth method. See ‘Molecular Absorption Spectroscopy’ VLab for the preparation of gold seed particles and various-sized colloidal gold particles. The conditions for preparing gold particles of three different sizes are given in Table 1.</p><p>After the preparation of the particles, leave them for ~12 hrs before using them as catalysts. The rate of catalysis was found to be very slow within 3 – 4 hrs of their preparations.</p></li>
<li>Turn on the spectrophotometer by clicking on the power button and wait for 30 min for initialization of the instrument.</li>
<li>Take 2 mL of a sample containing particles of a given average size in a cuvette.</li>
<li>Click on the micropipette to add 0.04 mL 10<sup>-2</sup> M eosin solution and then 0.40 mL 0.50 M sodium borohydride (NaBH<sub>4</sub>) solution to the particle solution present in the cuvette.</li>
<li>Immediately after the addition of NaBH<sub>4</sub>, kinetics of particle catalysed eosin reduction is followed by following the decrease in absorbance value at &lambda;=535 nm with time (at 30 &plusmn; 1&deg;C).</li>
<li>Click on the spectrophotometer lid to open it.</li>
<li>Click on the cuvette to place it in the sample cell holder of the instrument. One has to use water as the sample blank or reference in this measurement. Here a double beam spectrophotometer is shown. In this case, one can place the sample in the sample holder and the sample bank or reference in the reference holder simultaneously.</li>
<li>Close the spectrophotometer lid by clicking on it.</li>

<li>Run the scan in the kinetics mode by clicking on the Computer monitor and then on the 'Scan' tab and observe the scan. In the real spectrophotometer, an appropriate wavelength of light is selected (here &lambda;=535 nm) at which the decrease in absorbance vs. time scan is performed by using the accompanied computer software.</li>
<li>When the scan is complete click on the 'Next' tab for beginning the kinetic measurements with Sample 2 and Sample 3.</li>
<li>Repeat the above steps and study the kinetics of catalytic reduction of eosin in the presence of Sample 2 and then Sample 3 gold particles.</li>

<li>Collect data by clicking on the 'Data' tab.</li>
<li>Plot the absorbance vs. time for every sample. What is the nature of the plot?</li>

<li>Attempt first order fits of the data and calculate the rate constants. </li>
<li>Plot the rate constant vs. average particle size of the catalyst samples. Discuss your results.</li>
