Introduction
</h2>

<p>
A colloidal dispersion has been defined as a suspension of small particles in a
continuous medium. The colloidal dispersion clearly has two phases, one is the
bulk medium called disperse medium and another phase of the suspended
particles (aggregates of molecules or single molecules of size 1 µm to 1 nm)
called the dispersion phase. Colloids have the ability to scatter light and
they apparently lack osmotic pressure. Bellow we give some examples of colloidal
systems with the corresponding dispersion phases and disperse medium.

<h3>
Sol
</h3>

<p>
A sol is a colloidal suspension of solid particles in a continuous liquid
medium. Examples include blood, pigmented ink, and paint. They are
also known as lyophobic colloids. These are invariably substances that
are highly insoluble in the dispersing medium. The lyophobic colloids are
usually aggregates of small molecules. They can be prepared in a colloid
mill, or by chemical methods like Hydrolysis. They are very sensitive to
electrolytes.

<h3>
Gel
</h3>
<p>
Gels are a dispersion of molecules or particles within a liquid in which the
solid is the continuous phase and the liquid is the discontinuous phase.
These are solid, jelly-like material that can have properties ranging from
soft and weak to hard and tough. These are also known as lyophilic
colloids. Typical lyophilic systems would be proteins (especially gelatin)
or starch in water, rubber in benzene etc.
</p>

<h3>
Emulsion
</h3>

<p>
Emulsions are colloids where both the dispersed and the continuous phase are liquid. In an emulsion, one liquid (the dispersed phase) is
dispersed in the other (the continuous phase). Examples of emulsions include vinaigrettes, the photo-sensitive side of photographic film, milk and
cutting fluid for metal working.

<h3>
Structure of colloid
</h3>

<p>
The development of a net charge at the particle surface affects the 
distribution of ions in the surrounding interfacial region, resulting in an increased
concentration of counter ions (ions of opposite charge to that of the particle)
close to the surface. Thus an electrical double layer exists around each particle.
</P>

<p>
The liquid layer surrounding the particle exists as two parts; an inner region,
called the Stern layer, where the ions are strongly bound and an outer, diffuse,
region where they are less firmly attached. Within the diffuse layer there is
a notional boundary inside which the ions and particles form a stable entity.
When a particle moves (e.g. due to gravity), ions within the boundary move
with it, but any ions beyond the boundary do not travel with the particle. This
boundary is called the surface of hydrodynamic shear or slipping plane.
The potential that exists at this boundary is known as the Zeta potential.
</p>

<h3>
Electrophoresis
</h3>
<p>
When an electric field is applied across an electrolyte, charged
particles suspended in the electrolyte are attracted towards the electrode
of opposite charge. Viscous forces acting on the particles tend to oppose
this movement. When equilibrium is reached between these two opposing
forces, the particles move with constant velocity. The velocity of a 
particle in an electric field is commonly referred to as its Electrophoretic
mobility.

<h3>
Henry Equation
</h3>

<p>
Henry Equation is given by
</p>
<p>
U<sub>E</sub>=2εzf(ka)/η
</p>
<ul>
<li>
z=Zeta Potential
</li>
<li>
U<sub>E</sub>=Electrophoretic mobility
</li>

<li>
ε = Dielectric constant
</li>
<li>
η = Viscosity
</li>

<li>
f (ka) = Henry's function. Two values are generally used as 
approximations for the f(ka) determination - either 1.5 or 1.0.
</li>

</ul>
