<p>
The development of a net charge at the particle surface affeects the 
distribution of ions in the surrounding interfacial region, resulting in an increased
concentration of counter ions (ions of opposite charge to that of the particle)
close to the surface. Thus an electrical double layer exists around each par-
ticle.
</P>

<p>
The liquid layer surrounding the particle exists as two parts; an inner region,
called the Stern layer, where the ions are strongly bound and an outer, di?use,
region where they are less firmly attached. Within the diffuse layer there is
a notional boundary inside which the ions and particles form a stable entity.
When a particle moves (e.g. due to gravity), ions within the boundary move
with it, but any ions beyond the boundary do not travel with the particle. This
boundary is called the surface of hydrodynamic shear or slipping plane.
The potential that exists at this boundary is known as the Zeta potential.

<h3>
Metallic Colloids
</h3>
<p>
Metallic colloids are suspensions of sub-micrometer size metal particles in a
fluid.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Photography provides the most common occurrence of colloids: silver salts
are reduced in the process to form ?nely divided metallic silver of black
appearance.</li>

<li>Ruby glass, popular in Victorian times, is coloured by a dilute suspension
of colloidal gold.</li>

<li>Colloidal platinum, commonly known as platinum black, is used as a very
strong absorber of infra-red radiation.</li>

<li>
Colloidal transition metals are commonly used as catalysts in the oil in
dustry.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Henry Equation
</h3>

<p>
Henry Equation is given by
</p>
<p>
U<sub>E</sub>=2εzf(ka)/η
</p>
<ul>
<li>
z=Zeta Potential
</li>
<li>
U<sub>E</sub>=Electrophoretic mobility
</li>

<li>
ε = Dielectric constant
</li>
<li>
η = Viscosity
</li>

<li>
f (ka) = Henry's function. Two values are generally used as 
approximations for the f(ka) determination - either 1.5 or 1.0.
</li>

</ul>
