Introduction
</h2>

<p>
Colloidal metal particles are receiving renewed attention as important starting points for the generation of nanostructures and devices. However, the use of colloidal metal particles like Ag and Au colloids dates back to hundreds of years. Ag and Au colloids were used as coloring agents in ceramics and stained glass windows. Depending on their size and aggregation, these colloidal metal particles produce yellow, red, purple, blue or green colors. Similarly, these particles show many other interesting physical and chemical properties, which are often drastically different from their bulk counterparts. Many of the properties such as solubility, chemical reactivity, etc. are affected by their small sizes and high surface/volume ratio. We shall demonstrate the surface area effects on chemical properties Ag colloid. For this purpose, first we shall prepare Ag colloid and then study their chemical behavior. Ag colloids have been used as anti-microbial agents, in biomolecular labeling, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and sensing, and so on.

Theory

<p>
Ag colloids can be prepared by using various methods: chemical, electrochemical, Î³-radiation photochemical, laser ablation, etc. The simples preparation of Ag colloids is chemical reduction of silver salts by sodium citrate or sodium borohydride. Preparation of Ag colloid by borohydride reduction method requires only addition of sodium borohydride into an aqueous solution of silver salt like AgNO<sub>3</sub>. However, great care must be taken to obtain a stable and reproducible colloid. The purity of water and reagents, cleanliness of the glassware and personal skill are critical parameters. We shall follow the trisodium citrate (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>7</sub>Na<sub>3</sub>) reduction method here, which gives little better control over the stability due to the surface adsorption of relatively large citrate anions. The reduction reaction could be expressed as follows:

<div align="center"> n Ag<sup>0</sup> &#8594; (Ag<sup>0</sup>)<sub>n</sub><br> </div>

where n is the number of atoms aggregate together to form a colloid particle.
</p>
<p>
The colloid is made of nanoscale Ag particles suspended in the aqueous solution. The particles acquire negative charge and remain suspended in solution due to the repulsion caused by the surface adsorption of the citrate anions. Concentrations of AgNO<sub>3</sub> and reducing agent, reaction time, solution temperature, etc. influence the particle size. We are familiar with the surface area effects on the catalytic properties of finely divided particles of transition metals like platinum or palladium. By making catalyst particles very small, large surface areas are achieved with a small volume of material. Due to large surface area of contact and also microscopic roughness of the surface, colloidal particles are more reactive than their bulk counterparts. For example, when a saturated solution of mercuric chloride (HgCl<sub>2</sub>) is added to a yellow colored solution of Ag colloid, the yellow color disappears and a milky white color appears. This occurs due to the reaction between colloidal Ag and HgCl<sub>2</sub> producing precipitates of silver chloride (AgCl) and mercurous chloride (HgCl).

<h2>
Procedure
</h2>
<strong>To start the experiment do the following: </strong>
<ol>
<li>
Prepare a 100 ml of 10<sup>-3</sup> M AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution and a 10 mL of 1 % trisodium citrate solution by dissolving AgNO<sub>3</sub> and trisodium citrate, respectively, in deionized water.
</li>

<li>
Take a 500 mL volume conical flask (by clicking on it) and pour 100 ml of 10<sup>-3</sup> M AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution into the flask.
</li>

<li>
Place the beaker on a magnetic stirrer-cum-heater. 
</li>

<li>
Set the heater temperature to 100&deg;C (by clicking on the Heater knob)
</li>

<li>
Place a magnetic bar into the flask and set the stirrer to a medium speed.
</li>

<li>
The solution is heated to boiling.
</li>

<li>
When water in the flask starts boiling, to this solution add 10 mL of 1 % trisodium citrate drop by drop with the help of a clean dropper. Note down your observation.
</li>

<li> When the color change is steady, turn off the heater and stirrer and bring down the Ag colloid to the room temperature. </li>

<li> Collect 5 mL of the Ag colloid in a test tube from the above flask. </li>

<li> Add saturated HgCl<sub>2</sub> solution dropwise to the test tube and shake the test tube gently. Note down your observation.  </li>

</ol>
