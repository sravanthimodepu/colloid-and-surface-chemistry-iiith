<em><i>Agarose Gel Electrophoresis:</i></em> In this standard method to separate fragments of DNA, newly designed electrophoresis apparatus are used. The separation of fragments is then visualized by ultraviolet light after staining gels with ethidium bromide. Applications of different types of agarose are explained. The method for determining sizes of DNA fragments in the gel is shown.

<h><em> Preparation of a Gel as a Colloid: </em></h>
<p>
Gel electrophoresis refers to using a gel as an anticonvective medium and or sieving medium during electrophoresis. Gel electrophoresis is most commonly used for separation of biological macromolecules such as deoxyribonucleic acid(DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), or protein; however, gel electrophoresis can be used for separation of nanoparticles. Electrophoresis refers to the movement of a charged particle in an electrical field. Gels suppress the thermal convection caused by application of the electric field, and can also act as a sieving medium, retarding the passage of molecules; gels can also simply serve to maintain the finished separation, so that a post electrophoresis stain can be applied. 
</p>
<p>
Electrophoresis is a common lab technique used for separating DNA fragments. DNA samples are placed in a special gel and subjected to an electric field.<br>
Because DNA is negatively-charged, it moves toward the positive electrode. The DNA fragments that are shortest will travel farthest, while the longest fragments will remain closest to the origin. Using the same basic principles, electrophoresis can also be used to separate RNA and proteins.
</p>

<p>
After the electrophoresis is complete, the molecules in the gel can be stained to make them visible.Ethidium bromide, silver, or Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye may be used for this process. If the analyte molecules fluorescence underultraviolet light, a photograph can be taken of the gel under ultraviolet lighting conditions.<br>
	If several samples have been loaded into adjacent wells in the gel, they will run parallel in individual lanes. Depending on the number of different molecules, each lane shows separation of the components from the original mixture as one or more distinct bands, one band per component. Incomplete separation of the components can lead to overlapping bands, or to indistinguishable smears representing multiple unresolved components.
</p>

<p>
Bands in different lanes that end up at the same distance from the top contain molecules that passed through the gel with the same speed, which usually means they are approximately the same size. There are molecular weight size markers available that contain a mixture of molecules of known sizes. If such a marker was run on one lane in the gel parallel to the unknown samples, the bands observed can be compared to those of the unknown in order to determine their size. The distance a band travels is approximately inversely proportional to the logarithm of the size of the molecule.

<h2>
 Procedure
</h2>
<p>
<strong>To start the experiment do the following:</strong>
<ol>

<li>
Preparation of gel , refer to experiment on gel formation.
</li>

<li>
Pour the gel in to the gel-mold.[ by clicking on the flask]
</li>

<li>
Place the comb on the gel in one end.[by clicking on the comb]
</li>

<li>
Let the gel cool and solidify, remove the comb now by clicking on it.
</li>

<li>
Pour the buffer into the electrophoresis box by clicking on the buffer container and then pour the gel-mold in the electrophoresis box such that the gel should get barely submerged in the buffer.
</li>

<li>
You are ready to load the DNA sample in the gel. With a clean pipet tip, use micropipetor to suck up some loading buffer, then add it to the DNA sample.
</li>

<li>
Next use the micropipetor to transfer the DNA sample from tube to the well of the gel.<br>
First, suck up some DNA sample into the pipette tip. [click on the pipette tip to do the above process]
</li>

<li>
Eject the DNA sample from the pipette to first well of the gel.
</li>

<li>
Using a clean pipette tip suck up in the micropipetteor some DNA size standard, by clicking on the pipette tip.
</li>

<li>
Transfer the DNA size standard in to the next empty well [in the same method]. The DNA size standard contains DNA strands of known length.
</li>

<li>
Running it on gel will give you reference by which to estimate the length of DNA strands in your sample.
</li>

<li>
Turn on the electicity and run your gel. Connect the wires to their respective colour bye taking them to their respective knobs. Turn on the power supply.
</li>

<li>
Lets look closely in to the gel box to see whats happening, bubbles are coming out.
</li>

<li>
Repelled by negative charge the DNA moves to the other end of positive charge. Short DNA strands move more quickly than the long strands.
</li>

<li>
Take the gel-mold out of the electrophoresis box adn then stain the gel using DNA staining solution.The stain is a chemical called ethidium bromide which binds to DNA and shows flourescent light.[ drag with the mouse to achieve this operation].
</li>

<li>
Drag the gel out of the mold and put it into the staining solution.[ with the mouse].
</li>

<li>
Remove the gel out of the satining solution and put it in the UV box.[by draging it with the mouse].
</li>

<li>
Turn on the UV box.[use sunglasses in real life] [use the mouse click for the same]
</li>

<li>
Now you can finally determine the approximate length of the DNA strands in your sample.
</li>

<li>
Compare the bands of DNA strands with the bands of known length of DNA size starndards and record them. Check your results and observe the microscopic analysis of the process in details.
</li>
